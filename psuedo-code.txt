/*
Basic idea is that any module just gets imported, so users can create their own without really needing to know anything about the other modules
The menu system will just be an array that the user adds their module and icon to, the rest will be handled by the app
The menu simply exists to tell React which Component to render, the component is otherwise completely self-reliant without talking to the others
The individual Components can exist as their own file, just import them at the top of the main app and add them to the menu function
The app will load one by default (weather) and the menu will exist as just one button with a home icon. Tap the icon and menu expands to show 
whatever modules the user wants to add. 

The import examples include things like lights, where you could just display available lights from some existing API (Hue or HomeKit for example), 
rooms, where you could define devices grouped by room, Music which would be a remote control for iTunes or some other music app, 
Video which could just be an iframe to a plex instance or a video picker for Netflix and other services (probably needs its own sub menu)
The idea is there really shouldn't be limitations to what is displayed, just whatever can be implemented as a Component.
May need to implement something for Music/Video to ensure they don't lose their state between renders

//rough idea of code:

import Weather from './weather';
import Lights from './lights';
import Rooms from './rooms';
import Music from './itunes';
import Video from './plex';

const componentMap = {
    weather: Weather,
    lights: Lights,
    rooms: Rooms,
    music: Music,
    video: Video
};

//may be able to ignore above componentMap if I can push all of the needed pieces into one object and build an array of those objects
//then the menu would get build from this array, with the necessary component to render, label and icon for the menu
const componentMenu = [
    { label: 'Weather', component: Weather, icon: raindrop },
    { label: 'Lights', component: Lights, icon: lightbulb },
    { label: 'Rooms', component: Rooms, icon: door },
    { label: 'Music', component: Music, icon: musicnote },
    { label: 'Video', component: video, icon: film }
];

class App extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            component: "weather"
        };
    }

    render() {
        const { component } = this.state;

        const Child = componentMap[component];
        const Menu = 

        return ( 
            <div>
                <Child />
            </div>
            <div>
                <Menu />
            </div>
        );
    }
